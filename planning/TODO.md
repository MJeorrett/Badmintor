# Badmintor - TODO & Discussion Topics

## Technical Architecture Decisions

- [ ] Backend/database technology (.NET Core + SQL Server vs alternatives for PWA/offline needs)
- [ ] State management approach (Zustand vs Redux vs Context API - evaluate for this project)
- [ ] UI framework choice (Material-UI, Tailwind, Ant Design, plain CSS) - deeper evaluation needed
- [ ] Azure hosting/deployment strategy and services
- [ ] PWA implementation approach and complexity
- [ ] Offline data synchronization strategy with SQL Server backend
- [ ] AI integration approach (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI API, local models) for drill similarity and suggestions

## Feature Design & Structure

- [ ] Hierarchical tagging system detailed structure (Shot production, Footwork, Tactics, Physical sub-tags)
- [ ] Drill variant structure and relationships (different ways vs progression variants)
- [ ] Collaborative editing workflow for shared drill library
- [ ] Version control approach for drill changes
- [ ] Player level classification system design
- [ ] AI-assisted drill creation workflow and similarity detection algorithms
- [ ] Basic AI deduplication for MVP - scope and implementation approach (simple vs sophisticated)

## Phase Planning

- [ ] Define exact features for Phase 1 (Core), Phase 1 (Secondary), Phase 2, and Phase 3+
- [ ] Prioritize features within each phase
- [ ] Define MVP scope for initial release

## Data Structure & Models

- [ ] Drill data model definition.
- [ ] Session data model definition
- [ ] User roles and permissions structure
- [ ] Tag/category data relationships
- [ ] Court diagram data structure and storage approach

## User Experience & Workflow

- [ ] Session creation workflow (2 toolbox + 3 drills structure)
- [ ] Drill search and filtering interface design
- [ ] Multi-device sync user experience
- [ ] Offline functionality scope and limitations

## Future Considerations

- [ ] Cross-coach coordination features design
- [ ] Player progress tracking across multiple coaches
- [ ] Session history and theme analysis features
- [ ] Data privacy and sharing permissions for multi-coach environment
