# Badmintor - Decision Log

This document tracks all architectural and product decisions made.

## Pending Decisions

- **State management**: React built-ins vs Zustand (depends on UX complexity from SP02 spike)
- **PWA implementation**: Service worker strategy and offline capabilities scope

## Architecture Decisions

### AD-001: Backend Technology Stack

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Pending Validation  
**Decision**: Firebase ecosystem (Firestore + Cloud Functions + Auth + Hosting)  
**Rationale**:

- Unified ecosystem reduces integration complexity
- Firebase provides excellent offline sync and real-time capabilities
- Cloud Functions handle AI processing with Google Gemini integration
- Eliminates need for separate backend infrastructure
- Automatic multi-device sync and offline functionality
  **Alternatives Considered**: Hybrid Firebase + .NET API, Pure .NET + SQL Server, Supabase  
  **Validation**: SP01 - Firebase Integration Validation spike

### AD-002: Frontend UI Framework

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Decided  
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS  
**Rationale**:

- Extensive existing experience with Tailwind
- Lightweight and flexible compared to Material-UI
- Good performance for PWA requirements
- Doesn't constrain design choices
  **Alternatives Considered**: Material-UI, Ant Design, plain CSS

### AD-003: State Management Approach

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Pending UX Design  
**Decision**: To be determined based on drill management UX complexity  
**Rationale**:

- State management needs depend heavily on drill creation/editing workflow
- Firebase handles data persistence, main need is local UI state
- Simple React state may be sufficient for MVP
  **Alternatives Considered**: Zustand, Redux Toolkit, Context API  
  **Validation**: SP02 - Drill Management UX Design spike

### AD-004: AI Integration Platform

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Decided  
**Decision**: Google Gemini via Firebase Cloud Functions  
**Rationale**:

- Seamless integration with Firebase ecosystem
- Cloud Functions provide serverless execution for AI processing
- Google AI integration is native to Firebase platform
- Cost-effective for MVP usage levels
  **Alternatives Considered**: Azure OpenAI, OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude  
  **Impact**: Unified Google ecosystem, simplified architecture

### AD-005: Hosting Strategy

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Decided  
**Decision**: Firebase Hosting for complete solution  
**Rationale**:

- Single platform for frontend, backend, database, and hosting
- Automatic HTTPS, global CDN, and easy deployment
- Integrated with other Firebase services
- Cost-effective for MVP and beyond
  **Alternatives Considered**: Azure App Service, Netlify, Vercel  
  **Impact**: Simplified deployment pipeline, unified billing and management

## Product Decisions

### PD-001: MVP Scope - Single User

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Decided  
**Decision**: MVP will be single-user focused, not multi-coach collaboration  
**Rationale**:

- Simpler authentication and data model for initial development
- Allows focus on core drill library functionality
- Multi-coach features moved to later milestones
  **Impact**: Simplified user management, no role-based permissions needed initially

### PD-002: Offline Functionality Scope

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Decided  
**Decision**: Offline functionality deferred from MVP  
**Rationale**:

- MVP focuses on core drill library functionality
- Firebase provides offline sync automatically when implemented
- PWA offline capabilities can be added in future iterations
- Reduces initial complexity and development time
  **Impact**: Simpler MVP scope, faster time to market
